    "\n",
    "Many different kinds of features have been specially engineered to perform b-tagging. We will consider several of these today.\n",
    "\n",
    "## b hadrons\n",
    "\n",
    "B hadrons contain bottom quarks. \n",
    "These hadrons are unstable, meaning they naturally (and spontaneously) decay to hadrons containing lighter quarks, after a period of time (with a known median lifetime). \n",
    "\n",
    "Because of the large mass difference between bottom quarks and the lighter quarks, the lifetime of b hadrons tends to be relatively long: around $10^{-12}$ s. \n",
    "Given the fact that they are traveling near the speed of light, this means they can travel $O$(mm) in the detector before dacaying.\n",
    "The particle sproduced from this decay also tend to be higher energy\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can consider the properties of *displaced tracks* and *secondary vertices* (points of origin of collections of displaced tracks).\n",
    "In particular we quantify how displaced a track is in terms of its *impact parameter*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Single b-tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "For single b-tagging, consider the following image:\n",
    "<img src=\"http://cms-results.web.cern.ch/cms-results/public-results/publications/BTV-16-002/CMS-BTV-16-002_Figure_001.png\" alt=\"b-tagging\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, read {cite:p}`Sirunyan:2017ezt`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Double b-tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "For double b-tagging, consider the following image:\n",
    "<img src=\"https://github.com/jmduarte/capstone-particle-physics-domain/raw/master/weeks/Hbb.png\" alt=\"double b-tagging\" width=\"500\">\n",
    "\n",
    "For this, we can also take advantage of the so-called *jet substructure*. For more information, read {cite:p}`Marzani:2019hun,Asquith:2018igt`.\n"
